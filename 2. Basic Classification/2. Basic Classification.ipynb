0	"In this assignment you will implement the Naive Bayes Classifier. Before starting this assignment, make sure you understand the concepts discussed in the videos in Week 2 about Naive Bayes. You can also find it useful to read Chapter 1 of the textbook.\n"
1	"\n"
2	"\n"
3	"Also, make sure that you are familiar with the `numpy.ndarray` class of python's `numpy` library and that you are able to answer the following questions:\n"
4	"\n"
5	"Let's assume `a` is a numpy array.\n"
6	"* What is an array's shape (e.g., what is the meaning of `a.shape`)?  \n"
7	"* What is numpy's reshaping operation? How much computational over-head would it induce?  \n"
8	"* What is numpy's transpose operation, and how it is different from reshaping? Does it cause computation overhead?\n"
9	"* What is the meaning of the commands `a.reshape(-1, 1)` and `a.reshape(-1)`?\n"
10	"* Would happens to the variable `a` after we call `b = a.reshape(-1)`? Does any of the attributes of `a` change?\n"
11	"* How do assignments in python and numpy work in general?\n"
12	"    * Does the `b=a` statement use copying by value? Or is it copying by reference?\n"
13	"    * Would the answer to the previous question change depending on whether `a` is a numpy array or a scalar value?\n"
14	"    \n"
15	"You can answer all of these questions by\n"
16	"\n"
17	"    1. Reading numpy's documentation from https://numpy.org/doc/stable/.\n"
18	"    2. Making trials using dummy variables."

0	"The UC Irvine machine learning data repository hosts a famous dataset, the Pima Indians dataset, on whether a patient has diabetes originally owned by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and donated by Vincent Sigillito. You can find it at  https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database/data. This data has a set of attributes of patients, and a categorical variable telling whether the patient is diabetic or not. For several attributes in this data set, a value of 0 may indicate a missing value of the variable. It has a total of 768 data-points. \n"
1	"\n"
2	"* **Part 1-A)** First, you will build a simple naive Bayes classifier to classify this data set. We will use 20% of the data for evaluation and the other 80% for training. \n"
3	"\n"
4	"  You should use a normal distribution to model each of the class-conditional distributions.\n"
5	"\n"
6	"  Report the accuracy of the classifier on the 20% evaluation data, where accuracy is the number of correct predictions as a fraction of total predictions.\n"
7	"\n"
8	"* **Part 1-B)** Next, you will adjust your code so that, for attributes 3 (Diastolic blood pressure), 4 (Triceps skin fold thickness), 6 (Body mass index), and 8 (Age), it regards a value of 0 as a missing value when estimating the class-conditional distributions, and the posterior.\n"
9	"\n"
10	"  Report the accuracy of the classifier on the 20% that was held out for evaluation.\n"
11	"\n"
12	"* **Part 1-C)** Last, you will have some experience with SVMLight, an off-the-shelf implementation of Support Vector Machines or SVMs. For now, you don't need to understand much about SVM's, we will explore them in more depth in the following exercises. You will install SVMLight, which you can find at http://svmlight.joachims.org, to train and evaluate an SVM to classify this data.\n"
13	"\n"
14	"  You should NOT substitute NA values for zeros for attributes 3, 4, 6, and 8.\n"
15	"  \n"
16	"  Report the accuracy of the classifier on the held out 20%"

1	"\n"
2	"You can find this data at https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database/data. The Kaggle website offers valuable visualizations of the original data dimensions in its dashboard. It is quite insightful to take the time and make sense of the data using their dashboard before applying any method to the data."

1	"\n"
2	"* **Missing Data**: For several attributes in this data set, a value of 0 may indicate a missing value of the variable.\n"
3	"\n"
4	"* **Final Goal**: We want to build a classifier that can predict whether a patient has diabetes or not. To do this, we will train multiple kinds of models, and will be handing the missing data with different approaches for each method (i.e., some methods will ignore their existence, while others may do something about the missing data)."

Using functions that find the Gaussian PDF, and then taking their log is **numerically unstable**; the Gaussian PDF values can easily become extremely small numbers that cannot be represented using floating point standards and thus would be stored as zero. Taking the log of a zero value will throw an error. On the other hand, it is unnecessary to compute and store $p(x_i^{(j)}|y)$ in order to find $\\log p(x_i^{(j)}|y)$; you can write $\\log p(x_i^{(j)}|y)$ as a direct function of $\\mu_y$, $\\sigma_y$ and the features. This latter approach is numerically stable, and can be applied when the PDF values are much smaller than could be stored using the common standards."
